# CONTRIBUTIONS

This document will describe roles and duties of each member who is contributing to this package.

## MEMBERS:
1. Aishwarya Sharma
2. Jagdeep Brar
3. Harpreet Kaur

We have mutually decided over the following rules and duties while we were working on the package. 

- All will understand the functionality of the package together and will provide their opinions freely whenever required.
- Two of the team members will start working on the functions for the package and the third member will create one function and will test creating a dummy package to save time.
- Two members who worked on the functions will create respective test cases and will check the proper functionality.
- Once all the functions and test cases are completed, merging would be done together and the third member will create the package and test its working.
- Final package would be created and run together along with equal division of work (which will include documentation, creating vignette, Continuous integration etc )

All the individual contributions work would be done in different branches and would be merged later on.
